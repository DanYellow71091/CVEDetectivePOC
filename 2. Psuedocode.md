# Pseducode for script #

Utilize specific API token to access vulners database

Query vulners database by providing CPE product and version (as a string)
  * ex: "cpe:/a:cybozu:garoon:4.2.1"
  * resulting output should be a JSON string

Convert the JSON string into a JSON dictionary
  * using json.loads() <-- not sure exactly if that is correct

Find the key titled "id" or "cvelist" to find the CVE ID, "description" to give a short description of the CVE, and "href" for the link to the CVE for more details and possible remediation.
  * place outputs into a dictionary to avoid repetition
