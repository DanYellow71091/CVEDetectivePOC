# CVE Detective POC #

### This project's goal is to automate finding the CVE's associated with any given CPE's.  ###
####  This project will take 1 of two following 2 routes: ####
  * The CPE inputs will be checked against vulners.com's database using their API
  * The CPE inputs will be checked against vuln.sentnl

<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Minimum Viable Project Outcomes ####
  * We will be able to take a user's single CPE input and query it against either the vulner's or vuln's databse and get all the CVE's associated with said CPE
  
####  Stretch Goals #####
  * Our script will be able to take different forms of user input such as:
    * Multiple CPE's separated by commas
    * A file (text file or possibly an Excel file) of CPE's
  * Our script will be able to automate finding the CPE's of a given target machine using NMap through Python
  * Our script will be able to save the output (CVE's, description of the CVE, etc.) into an file (Excel file or text file)
